## Linear Regression Notes

This repository contains notes summarizing the key points on Linear Regression. These notes serve as a quick reference for understanding the fundamentals of linear regression. 

### Key Points:

1. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

2. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable.

3. The line in linear regression is represented by the equation: Y = β0 + β1*X1 + β2*X2 + ... + βn*Xn, where Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, ..., Xn are the independent variables, β0 is the intercept, and β1, β2, ..., βn are the coefficients representing the effect of each independent variable.

4. The coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

5. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

6. Linear regression can handle multiple independent variables, but assumes no multicollinearity among them.

7. It is important to assess assumptions such as linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors.

8. Linear regression can be used for prediction and inference.

9. The coefficient of determination (R-squared) measures how well the model fits the data.

10. Interpretation of coefficients considers their magnitudes and statistical significance.


## Assumptions of Linear Regression

Linear regression relies on certain assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. Here are the key assumptions to consider when working with linear regression:

1. **Linearity:** Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. If the relationship is nonlinear, the model may not be appropriate, and alternative regression techniques should be considered.

2. **Independence of errors:** The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other, meaning there should be no systematic patterns or correlations among the residuals. Violations of this assumption can lead to biased or inefficient estimates.

3. **Homoscedasticity:** Homoscedasticity assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent across the range of predicted values. Heteroscedasticity, where the variance of the errors varies, can affect the accuracy of the model's predictions.

4. **Normality of errors:** Linear regression assumes that the errors (residuals) follow a normal distribution. This assumption allows for valid statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation. If the errors are not normally distributed, transformations or alternative regression techniques may be necessary.

5. **No multicollinearity:** Multicollinearity occurs when there is a high correlation between independent variables. Linear regression assumes that the independent variables are not perfectly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable coefficient estimates and difficulty in interpreting the effects of individual variables.

It is crucial to assess these assumptions when working with linear regression. If any of these assumptions are violated, additional diagnostics or modifications to the data or model may be necessary to obtain reliable results.

Please note that this is a summary of the assumptions, and further research and exploration are recommended to gain a deeper understanding of each assumption and how to assess them in practice.

## OLS vs. Gradient Descent in Linear Regression

When it comes to estimating the parameters in linear regression, two commonly used methods are Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Gradient Descent. Here's a brief comparison of these methods:

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- **Method:** OLS is a closed-form solution that analytically calculates the optimal coefficients for linear regression.
- **Objective:** OLS minimizes the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Advantages:**
  - Provides the exact solution for linear regression if assumptions are met.
  - Computationally efficient for small to moderate-sized datasets.
  - Easy to interpret the coefficient estimates.
- **Assumptions:** OLS relies on assumptions like linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, normality of errors, and no multicollinearity among predictors.

### Gradient Descent
- **Method:** Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that gradually updates coefficients based on the slope of the error surface.
- **Objective:** Gradient Descent minimizes the cost function by finding the optimal coefficients iteratively.
- **Advantages:**
  - More flexible and applicable to a wider range of regression problems, including cases where OLS is not feasible.
  - Can handle large datasets efficiently.
  - Does not assume any specific distribution of errors.
- **Considerations:**
  - Selection of learning rate and convergence criteria can impact performance.
  - May require more computational resources for complex models or high-dimensional data.
  - Interpretation of coefficient estimates can be more challenging.

### Choosing the Method:
- **OLS:** OLS is often preferred when the assumptions of linear regression are met, the dataset is small to moderate-sized, and interpretability is crucial.
- **Gradient Descent:** Gradient Descent is suitable for cases where OLS assumptions are violated, large datasets are involved, or more flexible regression models are required.

Understanding the differences between OLS and Gradient Descent helps in selecting the appropriate method based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the regression problem at hand.
